## Define the following terms

1. Functional testing
2. Model-based testing
3. Fuzzing (and make an argument that on how fuzzing helps to solve the input space problem).
4. Please explain the term “formal methods” and list the reasons why it is not widely applied.

## Types of Testing:

5. Define what is Blackbox Testing; specifically, describe the limitations on this type of testing and the general approach to defining test cases. 

## Comparisons
### Define the following terms, state the difference between them
6. Blackbox Testing and Whitebox Testing
7. Dumb Fuzzing and Mutational Fuzzing

## Finite State Machine
8. Please list the coverage criteria for the finite-state machines. Describe each. Also, please mark feasibility at the end of each term and explain why.
9. A finite state machine is shown as following, for each feasible term above, please indicates how many tests are required in each term.

10. Define a doodle model (Finite State Machine) of expectations for testing your idea of a food ordering application (e.x. select items, put items in bag, select delivery address, payment, customizing items, etc...).

### Blackbox Fuzzing
11. List all different types of Blackbox Fuzzing and explain them.
12. In the smart fuzzing, input can be expressed in the certain grammar. Following is the grammar of US phone number.
```python
US_PHONE_GRAMMAR = {
     "<start>": ["<phone-number>"],
     "<phone-number>": ["(<area>)<exchange>-<line>"],
     "<area>": ["<lead-digit><digit><digit>"],
     "<exchange>": ["<lead-digit><digit><digit>"],
     "<line>": ["<digit><digit><digit><digit>"],
     "<lead-digit>": ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"],
     "<digit>": ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
}
```
Now please design a grammar that express the normal NC state plate number. (e.x. ABC-4567)

### Formal Methods

13. Practice of expression English requirements as checkable logic with the following grammar: 
<img src="https://github.com/txt/se20/blob/master/etc/img/r5f1.PNG">

- The number of cars in the parking lot exceeds 5000
- How many fruits have kernel?
- NC state has two campus.
- There is no signal in the Great Smokey Mountain.

14. In the context of formal methods, define the following terms:
_the modeling cost_
_the execution cost_,
_the personnel cost_
and 
_the development brake_.  Explain how each of these costs can limit the use of formal methods in
industry.

15.  For all the terms in the last question, explain how in on recent industrial context, these
issues could be tamed.
