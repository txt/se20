Be a "lab rat" in someone else's experiments. Two * one hour (maybe with different groups)

Remember, "lab rats" have rights:
  - Right to privacy : 
    - never record details that can personally identify you
  - Right to refuse: 
    - as long as you show up to the experimental session,  you get the tokens _even if you refuse to to the experiment and just sit there for an hour_
  - Right to be forgotten: 
    - all results have to be tagged with your secret token. On request, you can require that your own data be forgotten.

Tutors will manage the tokens (as per HW3).

# Project 3b

Goal: convince some venture capitalist that your code is worthy of their attention, using qualitative evidence.

Step1: Pick a Proj2 project that is both _interesting_ and _testable_
- Interesting: 
  - does it pass the "wow!" test? 
  - If you could show that it worked, would you care?
- Testable: 
  - Can you show that it works, _better than something else_
  - Does there exist some _opposite_  approach to the idea in the project? 
  - Does that project2 already implemented _X_ and its __opposite_?

Step2: Build the materials necessary to test your work

Step3: Run experiments
- If you need humans, you can assume eight hours of total time (between a bunch of people)
- If your stuff is all algorithms, then strive for 20-30 repeats  for both _X_ and its _opposite_, under  different conditions (e.g. different random number seeds)
  - But, say, 30 repeats is impossible if your task is too slow (e.g. some evil deep learning training ask).
  - Pragmatics matter!

Step4: Submit a repo with all your materials, examples,  scripts  used in this work. 
- The top level of that repo needs a _results.md_ file
describing 
your  methods, materials, observations, analysis,
conclusions and [threats to validity](https://web.pdx.edu/~stipakb/download/PA555/ResearchDesign.html).  

For Extra points
- In your analysis section including "good stats"; i.e. Statistical nonparametric significance tests and effect size tests
(to check if you are really  measuring  a medium to large significant effect).
 - For more on "good stats", see my [stats tutorial](https://github.com/txt/ase16/blob/master/doc/stats.md). 
   - That page has a small 1,2,3,4 exercise at the top of page that is worth doing.
   -  But that code has a (small) bug. Better that you use [this version instead](https://gist.github.com/timm/41b3a8790c1adce26d63c5874fbea393)

## Hints:  Remember the lessons of hw3:
- Ethics matter (3 rights!)
- Pretests matter. 
  - Before you try it out on other people, run a trial yourself to debug the materials
    - Uniformity in data collection matters. 
      - In your pretests, check that if 2 people watching the same behavior record the same events
- Environment matters. 
  - To get most our of your "lab rats", have everything set up to start and run fast
- Rate of data collection matters.
  - If your lab rat tasks  take a hour, you'll only get 8 measurements (bad)
  - But if tasks are five minutes long, you'll get 96 measurements
  - And if lab rat tasks take one minutes long, you'll get 480 measurements (really good)
- The write up matters. 
  - Don't just dump csv files into a Markdown file and hand that in. 
  - In your lab report, you need to write a commentary that summarizes your results using informative
  visualizations. 
    - All figures need to be discussed in the text.
