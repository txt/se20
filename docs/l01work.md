bad smells:

- no bramches, no pull requests, no activity, no good
- [commits to master](https://www.quora.com/I-work-for-a-startup-our-CTO-loves-writing-code-and-he-frequently-commits-bad-code-directly-to-the-master-branch-What-should-I-do)
  - not necesarily a bad thing (given enough pre-commit tooling) https://paulhammant.com/2013/05/06/googles-scaled-trunk-based-development/
