# Lecture: What is "good code"?

comapre two sites (me and anothr)

show them the release notes fro  zephyr

What is the kind of software other people want to work on?

the zephyr chart

sehields.io

but is t just shiny badges? what about "familiarlity"
- big framework and little things
- patterns. ruby on rails/
- "it makes sense to me"
- what if there is a common pattern that is not supported in language?
  - e..g open files should be closed. context managers in python

but is t just shiny badges? what about semantics

shw them dochdr

show them spaital trees

show them  make and bake

then tell them about open governence in zehypr and the linux kernel indicators. exercise: given GH data, what particla indcitors might predict for project health?

bad smells:

- no bramches, no pull requests, no activity, no good
- [commits to master](https://www.quora.com/I-work-for-a-startup-our-CTO-loves-writing-code-and-he-frequently-commits-bad-code-directly-to-the-master-branch-What-should-I-do)
  - not necesarily a bad thing (given enough pre-commit tooling) https://paulhammant.com/2013/05/06/googles-scaled-trunk-based-development/
